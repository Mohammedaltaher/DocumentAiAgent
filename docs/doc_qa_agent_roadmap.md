# Step-by-Step Guide: Building a Document QA Agent with LangChain and Ollama

This guide will help you create an agent that can accept document uploads and answer questions based on the uploaded content, using LangChain and Ollama.

## 1. Set Up Your Environment
- Install required packages:
  ```powershell
  pip install langchain langchain-community fastapi uvicorn python-multipart
  ```

## 2. Create the FastAPI App
- Build an API with endpoints to upload documents and ask questions.
- Use FastAPI for the web server and file uploads.

## 3. Integrate LangChain with Ollama
- Use LangChain's Ollama integration to connect to your local model.
- Use LangChain's document loaders (e.g., PDF, TXT) to process uploaded files.
- Store the document content in a retriever ( ChromaDB).

## 4. Implement the QA Logic
- When a user uploads a document, parse and store its content.
- When a user asks a question, retrieve relevant context from the document and send it to the Ollama model via LangChain.

## Next Steps
- Implement the document parsing and storage logic
- Connect the retriever to LangChain's QA chain
- Add authentication and a simple web UI if desired
